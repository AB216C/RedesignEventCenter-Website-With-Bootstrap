**EVENT-CENTER:Redesigning Nconcert Website using Bootstrap**

NConcert can be defined as the Next concert or a New concert. Its main goal is to give attendees or users full access to our services. Nconcert company offers a variety of services such as inviting famous artists from all over the world to perform at ATT stadium in Arlington Town, Texas. This website allows people to buy tickets, contact us for extra information, provide feedback, and sign up to receive notifications regarding discounts on tickets, future concerts, and other relevant information. The website also helps users see food menus. It also allows users to learn more about our company along with the artists who will perform in future concerts.

While building this website, previously, HTML and CSS codes or instructions were used. However, at this time, to make a website more responsive on computers, medium screens, and phones, bootstrap codes were used to the greatest percentage with few CSS codes. Bootstrap forms and tables were incorporated. Bootstrap utility classes for spacing, sizing, default colors, and image styling were used. Bootstrap components such as buttons, navigation bars, and carousels were used. Bootstrap 12-column grid system as well as bootstrap containers were used. It was beneficial to redesign this website using Bootstrap as it allows the designer to write less code. Plus, the final result of using Bootstrap is way more responsive than using both HTML and CSS codes only.

In addition, the project included a file called "someJavaScriptFunctions". This file contains a list of functions that will be useful in storing collected information and automating tasks for users such as the total amount of tickets. Lastly, these functions can help welcome and greet users after signing in.
